# GWAS_model
This repository is used to predict MDD patient response to ICBT treatment
We will be using three strategies:
-First strategy is to look for genes with similar biological functional annotations
-Second strategy is to use Elastic net to select the most important SNPs and their mapped genes and use them as the input
-Third strategy is to deploy other public open source models and modified the parameter in favour of our own dataset
