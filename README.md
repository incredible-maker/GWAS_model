# GWAS_model
This repository is used to predict MDD patient response to ICBT treatment
We will be using three strategies:
- **Strategy 1: Gene Functional Annotation**
  - Look for genes with similar biological functional annotations.

- **Strategy 2: Elastic Net Selection**
  - Use Elastic net to select the most important SNPs and their mapped genes.
  - Use these selected genes as the input for further analysis.

- **Strategy 3: Deploying Public Models**
  - Deploy other public open-source models.
  - Modify the parameters of these models in favor of your own dataset.
